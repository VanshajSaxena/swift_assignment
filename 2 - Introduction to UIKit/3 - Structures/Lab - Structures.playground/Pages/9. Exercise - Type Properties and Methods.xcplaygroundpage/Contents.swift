## Exercise - Type Properties and Methods
 
 Imagine you have an app that requires the user to log in. You may have a `User` struct similar to that shown below. However, in addition to keeping track of specific user information, you might want to have a way of knowing who the current logged in user is. Create a `currentUser` type property on the `User` struct below and assign it to a `user` object representing you. Now you can access the current user through the `User` struct. Print out the properties of `currentUser`.
 */
struct User {
    // This is a type property defined using the `static` keyword in swift, a type property in swift belongs to the type itself not the instance of the type. Any change to the type property reflect to all the instances of the type.
    static var currentUser:User?
    // This is a type method which is also defined using `static` keyword. The method takes user parameter of type User and assigns the currentUser type property of the type to the passed in parameter. Prints a msg that the user has logged in.
    static func logIn(user: User) {
        self.currentUser = user
        print("The user: \"\(user.userName)\" has logged in.")
    }
    var userName: String
    var email: String
    var age: Int
}
var user = User(userName: "User's Name", email: "usersemail@address.com" , age: 19)
User.currentUser = user
if let currentUser = User.currentUser {
print("User's name: \(currentUser.userName)")
print("User's email addr: \(currentUser.email)")
print("User's age: \(currentUser.age)")}
/*:
 There are other properties and actions associated with a `User` struct that might be good candidates for a type property or method. One might be a method for logging in. Go back and create a type method called `logIn(user:)` where `user` is of type `User`. In the body of the method, assign the passed in user to the `currentUser` property, and print out a statement using the user's userName saying that the user has logged in.
 
 Below, call the `logIn(user:)` method and pass in a different `User` instance than what you assigned to currentUser above. Observe the printout in the console.
 */
var userTwo = User(userName: "New User", email: "newuseremail.com", age: 20 )
User.logIn(user: userTwo )
